_EXECUTABLE - path to db_recover executable
#   Ice_DB_STAT_EXECUTABLE - path to db_stat executable
#   Ice_DB_TUNER_EXECUTABLE - path to db_tuner executable
#   Ice_DB_UPGRADE_EXECUTABLE - path to db_upgrade executable

#
# Ice component libraries are reported in::
#
#   Ice_<C>_FOUND - ON if component was found
#   Ice_<C>_LIBRARIES - libraries for component
#
# Note that ``<C>`` is the uppercased name of the component.
#
# This module reads hints about search results from::
#
#   Ice_HOME - the root of the Ice installation
#
# The environment variable ``ICE_HOME`` may also be used; the
# Ice_HOME variable takes precedence.
#
# .. note::
#   On Windows, Ice 3.7.0 and later provide libraries via the NuGet
#   package manager.  Appropriate NuGet packages will be searched for
#   using ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, or alternatively ``Ice_HOME`` may be
#   set to the location of a specific NuGet package to restrict the
#   search.
#
# The following cache variables may also be set::
#
#   Ice_<P>_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable <P>
#   Ice_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice headers
#   Ice_SLICE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice slice interface
#                   definitions
#   Ice_<C>_LIBRARY - the library for component <C>
#
# .. note::
#
#   In most cases none of the above variables will require setting,
#   unless multiple Ice versions are available and a specific version
#   is required.  On Windows, the most recent version of Ice will be
#   found through the registry.  On Unix, the programs, headers and
#   libraries will usually be in standard locations, but Ice_SLICE_DIRS
#   might not be automatically detected (commonly known locations are
#   searched).  All the other variables are defaulted using Ice_HOME,
#   if set.  It's possible to set Ice_HOME and selectively specify
#   alternative locations for the other components; this might be
#   required for e.g. newer versions of Visual Studio i
